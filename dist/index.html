        <p>
          Welcome! I'm Corrie Stroup, a Front-End Developer, born and raised in
          the Southern/Mid-Western US. I currently live in Vietnam with my
          lovely wife and three adorable (and frustrating) cats.

      <div class="about container" id="about">
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Take a look at the tabs below to get a bit of a cross-section of who I
          am!
        </p>

        <div class="education dropdown">
          <span class="dropdownheader">Education</span>
          <div class="dropdownblurb hidden">
            <p>
              I studied natural languages (German) and Second Language Pedagogy,
              as language systems have always been fascinating to me. Although I
              am not classically educated in Computer Science, I do find the
              field riveting. I began programming as a hobby in university,
              starting by hacking together a few Python scripts here and there.
              I made a few personal-use apps in the first few years I was
              abroad, but my Python development fell to the wayside.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2019, I have been absolutely devouring anything and
              everything related to Web Development. After spending the
              requisite time in tutorial Hell, I found The Odin Project, which
              gave me a solid direction and has provided me the needed
              springboard to dive right into webdev.

        <div class="lifephilosophy dropdown">
          <span class="dropdownheader">Life Philosophy</span>
          <div class="dropdownblurb hidden">
            <p>
              In life, as in programming, I believe that less is more. That's
              not to say I live a minimalistic lifestyle; no - on the contrary,
              I believe it's important to enjoy life. But the more moving parts
              something has, the more opportunities for something to go wrong.
              Minimize the parts, minimize the margin of error, enjoy a smooth
              and productive life.

          <span class="dropdownheader">Passion</span>
          <div class="dropdownblurb hidden">
            <p>
              I have a passion for problem solving and pattern recognition. What
              originally helped me choose to study natural languages in
              university also helped me to find a footing in programming
              languages: I'm a man of syntax, I love discovering new patterns,
              new and better ways of accomplishing tasks. My appetite for
              learning and acquiring new skills is never satiated, which is what
              drives me and keeps me passionate about programming: it's always
              changing, new shifts, new paradigms, new ideas to learn and
              develop.
